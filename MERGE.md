   - Click "Compare & pull request" for the `feature/rag-pdf-chat` branch
   - Add title: "feat: Add RAG-enabled PDF chat functionality"
   - Add description with the feature summary above
   - Request review if needed
   - Merge when approved

### Option 2: GitHub CLI

1. Push the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/rag-pdf-chat
   ```

2. Create and merge PR using GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   # Create the pull request
   gh pr create --title "feat: Add RAG-enabled PDF chat functionality" --body "Adds comprehensive RAG functionality for PDF document chat. See MERGE.md for details."
   
   # Merge the pull request (after any required reviews)
   gh pr merge --merge
   ```

3. Switch back to main and pull the changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. Clean up the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/rag-pdf-chat
   git push origin --delete feature/rag-pdf-chat
   ```

## Post-Merge Setup

After merging, users will need to:

1. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment**:
   - Ensure OpenAI API key is available for the aimakerspace library
   - The application will prompt for API key in the UI

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd api
   python app.py

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## Features Available After Merge

- **PDF Upload**: Users can upload PDF documents for processing
- **Semantic Search**: Advanced vector-based search through document content
- **RAG Chat**: AI responses based exclusively on uploaded document content
- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates during PDF processing and chat
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface optimized for document interaction
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages

## Performance Notes

- PDF processing time depends on document size (typically 10-30 seconds for medium documents)
- Embedding generation uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model
- Chat responses use `gpt-4o-mini` model for cost-effective operation
- Vector database operations are optimized with numpy for fast similarity search
